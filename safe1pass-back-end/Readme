This Rest API Project has been targeted to deploy on JBoss, why? JBoss? Because I like the word BOSS ;-)
The core lib of this project is to use Spring Boot.

Feel free to make this project deployable to WebSphere, WebLogic ......
For Spring Boot, it should work on Tomcat right off the box.

In addition, this project includes a Postman Project to test against all APIs.
